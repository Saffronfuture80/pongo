Pong but in 2021
PONGO by Saffronfuture80#0048
2021

First, you need two players - beware of the ancient curse that afflicts people who try to play
two-player games by themselves, right hand vs. left hand. Nobody has ever found a cure.

Second, don't force Vsync off with your graphics driver, or the game will run at 8x speed.

Third, you need some kind of controllers:

- The game was originally designed to be played with two gamepads, using the twin analog sticks.
The left stick moves your bat up and down, the right stick changes which way it is pointing.

- If you must, you can play it with two mice, using the vertical axis to move up and 
the horizontal axis to spin the bats. It's no fun, but I implemented it because...

- ...the game is best played with arcade spinners, which are usually configured 
as mouse axes. If you have two spinners, set them to the mouse X axis, which spins the bats.
Then you can map the keyboard cursor keys or the left and right mouse buttons to the vertical
movement of the bats.

- For the best possible experience with PONGO, use 4 spinners. Each player should have one
spinner mapped to the X axis and one to the Y axis.

- If you're feeling especially creative, you can map some weird USB controllers to these
axes, mapping them as either joystick or mouse axes.
